A Continual Learning Benchmark for Problematic Content Detection - Detecting problematic content is a multifaceted and ever-changing task, influenced by social dynamics, user populations, diversity of sources, and evolving language. There has been significant efforts, both in academia and in industry, to develop annotated resources that capture various aspects of problematic content. Due to researchers' diverse objectives, the annotations are inconsistent and hence, reports of progress on detection of problematic content  are fragmented. This pattern is expected to persist unless we consolidate resources considering the dynamic nature of the problem. We propose integrating the available resources, and leveraging their dynamic nature to break this pattern. In this paper, we introduce a continual learning benchmark and framework for problematic content detection comprising over 84 related tasks encompassing 15 annotation schemas from 8 sources. Our benchmark creates a novel measure of progress: prioritizing the adaptability of classifiers to evolving tasks over excelling in specific tasks.
